## Deactivate Stripe in Backend
The Quivr platform allows user to buy more credits to use the platform. This is done through Stripe.

If you want to deactivate Stripe, you need to set the `DEACTIVATE_STRIPE=true` to an empty string. This will disable the payment system and the users will not be able to buy more credits.

You can do this by updating the `.env` file.

## Hide Tokens in Frontend

If you want to hide the tokens in the frontend, you need to set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_TOKENS=false` to an empty string. This will hide the tokens in the frontend.

You can do this by updating the `.env` file.
