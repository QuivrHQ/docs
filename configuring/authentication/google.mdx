# Google

Supabase Auth supports Sign in with Google for the web, native Android applications, and Chrome extensions.

## Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud project. Go to the [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project if necessary.

## Configuration

To support Sign In with Google, you need to configure the Google provider for your Supabase project.

#### Application Code Configuration

To use your own application code:

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the [Consent Screen configuration page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent).
   - The consent screen is the view shown to your users when they consent to signing in to your app.
2. Under **Authorized domains**, add your Supabase project's domain, which has the form `<PROJECT_ID>.supabase.co`.
3. Configure the following non-sensitive scopes:
   - `.../auth/userinfo.email`
   - `...auth/userinfo.profile`
   - `openid`
4. Go to the [API Credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
5. Click **Create credentials** and choose **OAuth Client ID**.
6. For application type, choose **Web application**.
7. Under **Authorized JavaScript origins**, add your site URL.
8. Under **Authorized redirect URLs**, enter the callback URL from the Supabase dashboard.
   - Expand the Google Auth Provider section to display it.
   - The redirect URL is visible to your users. You can customize it by configuring custom domains.
9. When you finish configuring your credentials, you will be shown your client ID and secret.
   - Add these to the Google Auth Provider section of the Supabase Dashboard.
   - In local development, you can add the client ID and secret to your `config.toml` file.

#### Google Pre-built Configuration

To use Google's pre-built signin buttons:

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the [Consent Screen configuration page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent).
   - The consent screen is the view shown to your users when they consent to signing in to your app.
   - Configure the screen to your liking, making sure you add links to your app's privacy policy and terms of service.
2. Go to the [API Credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
3. Click **Create credentials** and choose **OAuth Client ID**.
4. For application type, choose **Web application**.
5. Under **Authorized JavaScript origins** and **Authorized redirect URLs**, add your site URL.
   - This is the URL of the website where the signin button will appear, not your Supabase project domain.
   - If you're testing in localhost, ensure that you have `http://localhost` set in the Authorized JavaScript origins section as well. This is important when integrating with Google One-Tap to ensure you can use it locally.
6. When you finish configuring your credentials, you will be shown your client ID.
   - Add this to the Authorized Client IDs field in the Google Auth Provider section of the Supabase Dashboard.
   - Leave the OAuth client ID and secret blank. You don't need them when using Google's pre-built approach.

## Self Hosted Setup

When self-hosting, you need to set the following variables in your `config.toml` file in supabase.
