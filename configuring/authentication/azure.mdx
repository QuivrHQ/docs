To enable Azure (Microsoft) Auth for your project, you need to set up an Azure OAuth application and add the application credentials to your Supabase Dashboard.

## Overview

Setting up OAuth with Azure consists of four broad steps:

1. Create an OAuth application under Azure Entra ID.
2. Add a secret to the application.
3. Add the Supabase Auth callback URL to the allowlist in the OAuth application in Azure.
4. Configure the client ID and secret of the OAuth application within the Supabase Auth dashboard.

## Access your Azure Developer account

1. Go to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Login and select **Microsoft Entra ID** under the list of Azure Services.

## Register an application

1. Under **Microsoft Entra ID**, select **App registrations** in the side panel and select **New registration**.
2. Choose a name and select your preferred option for the supported account types.
3. Specify a Web Redirect URI. It should look like this: `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
4. Finally, select **Register** at the bottom of the screen.

## Obtain a client ID and secret

1. Once your app has been registered, the client ID can be found under the list of app registrations under the column titled **Application (client) ID**. You can also find it in the app overview screen.
2. Place the Client ID in the Azure configuration screen in the Supabase Auth dashboard.

### Add a certificate or secret

1. Select **Add a certificate or secret** in the app overview screen and open the **Client secrets** tab.
2. Select **New client secret** to create a new client secret.
3. Choose a preferred expiry time of the secret. Make sure you record this in your calendar days in advance so you have enough time to create a new one without suffering from any downtime.
4. Once the secret is generated, place the **Value** column (not Secret ID) in the Azure configuration screen in the Supabase Auth dashboard.

## Self Hosted Setup

When self-hosting, you need to set the following variables in your `config.toml` file in supabase.
