## Create Brains connected to Specific Data Sources

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define your Brain identity">
    Choose a snippet to personalize your Brain, then name your Brain and provide
    a description. These details help you recognize your Brain and clarify its
    purpose, but they do not affect its functionality.

  <Step title="Feed your Brain">
    Add knowledge to your Brain by providing data. This will allow the Brain to
    answer your questions accurately based on the stored knowledge.

        feed the Brain with structured information.

      <Step title="From URL" icon="link">
        Feed your Brain with knowledge by providing URLs, which will allow it to
        extract and store the data from web pages.

        Integrate with connected services like Dropbox, Google Drive, or
