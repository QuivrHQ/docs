## Interact with your knowledge base

1. **Chat with your Brains**  
   You can chat with each of your brains, which will give you responses based on
   the knowledge you have provided them.

2. **Chat with models**  
   Quivr allows you to interact directly with AI models such as GPT-4 and Mistral.
   Simply start a conversation with the AI to get answers and support based on a
   broad range of data and knowledge.

3. **Threads History**  
   You can access and continue your past conversations with your brains.

<Tip>
  In the same thread, you can decide to talk to multiple brains and/or models.
  For example, generate content from a first brain and reformulate the response
  using a model.
</Tip>

For each response provided by a Brain, you can access the sources by clicking on the file icon at the bottom of the response. You can also like or dislike the response, which will help Quivr improve its responses.
