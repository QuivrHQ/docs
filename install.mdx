## Enterprise Installation 🚀

These instructions are for Quivr Enterprise customers only. If you're looking for the community edition, please visit our [open source documentation](https://docs.quivr.app/open-source).

### Prerequisites 📋

Ensure you have the following:
- An active Quivr Enterprise subscription
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### 60 seconds Installation 💽

You can find the installation video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXBa6dZJN48).

- **Step 1**: Clone the repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/quivrhq/enterprise.git && cd enterprise
  ```

- **Step 2**: Copy the `.env.example` files

  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

- **Step 3**: Update the `.env` files

  ```bash
  vim .env # or emacs or vscode or nano
  ```

  Update **OPENAI_API_KEY** in the `.env` file.

  You just need to update the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable in the `.env` file. You can get your API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). You need to create an account first. And put your credit card information. Don't worry, you won't be charged unless you use the API. You can find more information about the pricing [here](https://openai.com/pricing/).

  > Want to use [Ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai) instead?
  > Uncomment the following lines in the `.env` file:
  > OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL
  > Run the following command to start Ollama: `ollama run llama2`
  > You can find more information about Ollama [here](https://ollama.ai/).

- **Step 4**: Launch the project

  ```bash
  cd backend && supabase start
  ```
  and then 
  
  ```bash
  cd ../
  docker compose pull
  docker compose up
  ```

  If you have a Mac, go to Docker Desktop > Settings > General and check that the "file sharing implementation" is set to `VirtioFS`.

  If you are a developer, you can run the project in development mode with the following command: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build`

- **Step 5**: Login to the app

  You can now sign in to the app with `admin@quivr.app` & `admin`. You can access the app at [http://localhost:3000/login](http://localhost:3000/login).

  You can access Quivr backend API at [http://localhost:5050/docs](http://localhost:5050/docs)
